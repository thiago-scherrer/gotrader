## Requirements

- docker => 19.03.8
- docker-compose => 1.25.4
- bitmex account

## How it works

Its purpose is to automate a rule created by the trader.

## Caution

This bot still under construction and does not guarantee anything, it may not even work properly. You can lose money with it! **Test the gotrader bot in the test network first!**
But if you have good results, PR the logic =)

Don't panic!

## Enabled

- New and close order, buy or sell
- leverage
- Send messages to matrix.org
- Able to use custom logic

## Supported Contracts

- XBTUSD
- ETHUSD

## Runing with docker

Go to the config folder called **configs** and then, copy **config-example.yml** to the **config.yml**. Add your settings to the file and save.

Go to the **example/** folder and then, choose or create a strategy and modify with your trade strategies and after this, copy the file like **logic-short-trade_go** to the folder **internal/logic** with the name **logic.go**. Go back to the root dir and follow the steps below:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

After *test* and *build*, run the bot (background):

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

You can see the logs with *docker logs* command, like:

```bash
docker logs -f gotrader
```

To stop the bot, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Logic

The acual logic can be changed on *internal/logic/*. A simple example can be found on *examples/*.

## TO-DO

- best log control
- more documentation
- more logic
